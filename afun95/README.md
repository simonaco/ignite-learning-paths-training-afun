## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders is curious about the concept behind "serverless" computing â€“ the idea that they can run small pieces of code in the cloud or workflow, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. In this session, weâ€™ll cover the world of Azure Functions, starting with an explanation of the servers behind serverless, exploring the languages and integrations available, and ending with a demo of using Azure Logic Apps and Azure Function working together.

## Get Started

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](#slides) | [Demos](demos/readme.md) | [Deployment](deployment/README.md) | 
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| 41 slides - 20 minutes, | 4 demos - 25 minutes, | 1 automated deployment

 [Full-length video can be viewed here](https://globaleventcdn.blob.core.windows.net/assets/afun/afun95/afun95-full-length.mp4).

## Slides

THe slides are divises in four sections:

----------------------------|---------------|------
Whatâ€™s serverless?          | 4-18          | It starts agnostic, then at slide 14 is Azure focus
Azure Logic App             | 19-24, 25     | 
Azure Function              | 26-32, 33, 34 |
How it all works together   | 35            |
